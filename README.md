# Project - What makes movies profitable 

## Introduction

In this project I set out to answer the question of what it is that makes for a successful (profitable) movie. I will used my findings for the purpose of providing insightful recommendations to a major software company that's thinking about breaking into the film industry. To be more precise, I provided recommendations on the type of movies to focus on to ensure immediate success.

## Objectives

To accomplish ths task I looked at [<i>The Movies Dataset</i>](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) on Kaggle. My approach was to uncover the most successful movies by profit and return on investment (ROI) through the years. I looked at the numbers for films from 1930 through the present. I wanted to understand not only how they perform overall through history, but also in intervals of 20 years. 

The idea was to find that sweet spot where both profits and ROI intersect. Part of the challange turned out to be that the most successful films can appear to be outliers compared to the vast majority of movies. So it was important to realize that the fact that there are datapoint that vary dramatically from the majority of the data does not mean that they are not valid. In fact, according to [this](https://parlaystudios.com/blog/feature-film-budget-breakdown/) article, the average cost of a feature file is between $70 and $90 million. Most movies through time have had much lower budgets. I only looked at movies with bugets of $1 million or more.

## Findings

It turns out that throughout the history of the movies, dramas consistanly provided the best ROI and it continues so. However, when it comes to raw profits, Adventure have lead the way. Another genre that did quite well in ROI was Horror. They are generally made with lower budgets.
